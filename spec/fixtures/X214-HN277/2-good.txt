Business Scenario 2: Clearinghouse Example 

In the following example, Last Billing Service submitted an ANSI 837 Professional claim file with 3 claims totaling $800.00 to First Clearinghouse on January 31, 2006 for Smith Clinic. This file was transmitted after the cutoff time for same day processing, so First Clearinghouse processed the file on February 1, 2006 and notified Last Billing Service on February 1, 2006 that their file was rejected as they have not completed the trading partner enrollment process, therefore, they are not a valid trading partner with First Clearinghouse.
